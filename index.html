             <h2>About Sunset</h2>
            <p>Sunsets are a fascinating topic because they combine the science of light with the artistry of nature. When the sun sets, it appears to descend below the horizon, creating a spectrum of colors in the sky. This phenomenon occurs due to the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere. Shorter wavelengths like blue and violet scatter more, leaving longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sunset hues.</p>
